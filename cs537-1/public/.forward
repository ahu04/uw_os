#
# this file (~/public/.forward on Unix, U:public\.forward on Windows NT) 
# controls how your electronic mail is forwarded.
#
# lines that start with a "#" character are comments
#
# If you want your mail delivered on a computer outside CS or
# Statistics, put the full email address of the recipient in this
# file, on a line by itself.
#
# For example:
#     If your students.wisc.edu email address is "bucky@students.wisc.edu", 
#     and you want all your mail to be sent to that account, put the
#     following in this file, on a line by itself (after these comments):
#		bucky@students.wisc.edu
# 
#     REMEMBER TO CHANGE THE NAME from "bucky" to YOUR use name!!!
#
# If you do not want your mail forwarded to another site, leave this
# file empty (except for these comments)
#
# DO NOT use this file to forward mail from one CS or Statistics
# computer to another -- it will not work. If you want to change your
# mail home within CS or Statistics, please send mail to lab@cs.wisc.edu 
# requesting the change. 
#
# SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR "COURSE" ACCOUNTS:
#
# 	this file must be owned by "root". It should be set that way already.
#	If not, please send mail to lab@cs.wisc.edu
